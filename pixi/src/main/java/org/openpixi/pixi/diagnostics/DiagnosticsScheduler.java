/**
 * A wrapper class for all diagnostics that should be applied to the simulation during
 * execution.
 * It can perform diagnostics on the particles and on the grid separately. Same goes for
 * the extraction of the calculated data. The output methods are meant to be used by some
 * kind of UI that provides an DataOutput object. The getData() methods of the diagnostic
 * classes are called which then write to the DataOutput object in their specific way.
 * The UI can then decide how it processes the data further.
 * TODO Split this in local and global diagnostics. The local ones can be performed on
 * a part of the whole simulation (like the part running on one computing node) whereas
 * the global methods need data from the whole simulation.
 * TODO parallelize the diagnostics methods.
