<!-- 	Each XML file must have a root element. In our case its <settings>.
	But you can choose anyone you like. You will get an error, but the
	XML will still be parsed.

	The following tags are available:
	
	Should be set only once (if set multiple times the last value is used):
	runid				can be any string
	iterations			must be a positive integer
	numberOfParticles		must be a positive integer
	simulationWidth			must be a positive number
	simulationHeight		must be a positive number
	timeStep			must be a positive number

	interpolatorAlgorithm		must be either "Cloud In Cell" or 
					"Charge Conserving CIC" (not case sensitive)

	particleSolver			"Euler", "Leap Frog", "Boris" or any other 
					supported algorithm. (not case sensitive)
	
	simulationType			"Sequential" or "Parallel", parallel means 
					using OpenCL. (not case sensitive)
	
	writeToFile			"Yes" or "No". It determines if the result(the
					list of particles and cells) will be written to a file.
					"particles_seq.txt" and "cells_seq.txt" - for the sequential version;
					"particles_ocl.txt" and "cells_ocl.txt"- for the OpenCL version.
					(not case sensitive)

	Can be set multiple times:
	diagnostics			can be either "Potential" or "Kinetic Energy".
					NOTE: You MUST specify an attribute which is a
					positive integer! Name it "i" for interval.
					It determines the interval in which the diagnostic
					method should be run. Choose 0 if you want it to run
					in the beginning only. Choose it equal to the number
					of iteration if you want it to run at the beginning
					AND in the end.
	
	The tags are NOT case sensitive!

	If the contents of a tag are not set properly, the program informs you about
	that and overrides your setting with the default one. The program also informs
	you about what the default setting is.

	If you want to use this XML file you must specify the path to it as the FIRST argument
	to MainBatch. If you want to have diagnostics output you must specify a writable directory
	as the second argument to MainBatch.

	You can use an empty XML file by specifying only the root element. Then the program will run
	with defaults.
